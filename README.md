- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @I-am-Future, a master student in computer science @ UCSD!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: (see [my website](https://i-am-future.github.io/) for details)
  -  robotics (like arm robots and quadruped robots),
  -  embodied AI (multimodal perception, decision, control for the robots mentioned above),
  -  deep learning & reinforcement learning (this is the tool for the previous topic),
  -  computer vision (especially 3D vision, one of modalities for the previous topic), and
  -  many other things (things I feel interesting, e.g., HPC, NLP, RL...).
- ðŸŒ± Any discussion about anything with me is welcomed!
