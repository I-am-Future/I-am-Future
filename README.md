- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @I-am-Future, a 4th year undergraduate in CS major.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
  -  robotics (like arm robots and dexterous hands),
  -  embodied AI (multimodal perception, decision, control for the robots mentioned above),
  -  deep learning (this is the tool for previous topic),
  -  computer vision (especially 3D vision, one of modalities for previous topic), and
  -  many other things (things I feel interesting, e.g., HPC, NLP, RL...).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently also learning many new things, but can do nothing well.
